##Essay Description
In the games there has been much conflict over the influence of games on individuals and society, a section of this is the representation of genders. This can be the physical appearance of the avatars or the personality that comes with them. This essay proposes the question "Should We Make A Change?", is it time to start representing genders more accurately to the real world in games? I will be looking into how games represent genders, what peoples issues with them are and why they are represented in this way. There seems to be a misconception that it is only females that are represented in an unrealistic fashion, as there are few papers and little research done to look into this. That being said I will still be looking into both genders.

Video gaming continues to be an ethically contentious topic, not the least because of its claimed negative effects on individuals and the society they live within. By taking a consequentialist approach to the issue---setting out the consequences of video games and gaming, and assessing those consequences for their ethically relevant properties---video gaming can be given a partial moral defence against its critics.

[Designing Avatars](https://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1413679&CFID=671240463&CFTOKEN=83460395)


This document summarizes three studies on avatars leading us to propose considerations for designing avatars. A background study was conducted on earlier avatar research and the key findings are summarized in this document. Based on the background study, we conducted focus groups discussion with active online community users (who participated in social networking web sites, virtual worlds, and massively multi-player online games) to gain a better understanding of what aspects in designing avatars are important to users. From those two studies we elaborated a list of considerations topicss pointing out aspects that designers can use for avatar design. Moreover, for our avatar design project, we conducted a third study where we investigated the use of online avatar design applications. Through the analysis of this third study, we evaluated the considerations from the user point of view. In conclusion, we discuss the findings and propose a summarized list of the considerations that appear essential when designing new virtual worlds involving avatars. These design considerations concern the way avatars look, what they can do, the way they can be used for communication, the context in which they are created, how many avatars can be created and in under what kind of governance, who owns the avatar, and how to plan avatar design.

Hypersexual avatars: who wants them?
](http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1178516)

Women are less dedicated to computer gaming than men. Previous studies show that one reason might be that current games exhibit hypersexualised female avatars: avatars that have exaggerated sexual signals to which female players object. We report on a study in which this hypothesis was tested. The study was performed with men and women aged 17--22 from the Stockholm area. In our study, both women and men showed similar preferences in avatar selections. However, we also found that the women seemed to be more aware of personality stereotypes, in that they were more consistent in attributing a hypersexual avatar to a 'bimbo' personality.

In the past few years, there has been an increase in research examining gender issues in games. While there have been quite a lot of studies that concentrate on girls and women as players and emphasize specific preferences and gaming habits (cf. Bonanno and Kommers 2005, Carr 2005), other research underlines that there is no such thing as the female approach to video games (cf. Hayes 2007). In addition to concentrating on women playing games, game scholars examine aesthetics, sexualized images and gendered performances of game characters (cf. Schleiner 2001, Richard 2004).

[Gender Games: A Content Analysis Of Gender Portrayals In Modern, Narrative Video Games](http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=sociology_theses)

Video games are a multi-billion dollar industry; 67% of households in the Un
ited States have at 
least one game player. The considerable reach of this medium makes it c
rucial to assess the messages that 
audiences are taking away concerning gender in these games. In this content
 analysis, I investigate the 
representation of binary gender in the narratives of modern video games from the
 perspective of cultiva-
tion theory. Ten popular games from 2007 through 2013 are selected for this investig
ation. The character-
istics of each game’s main character are evaluated in the contex
t of the narrative to uncover emergent 
trends, tropes, and themes over the course of gameplay. Men outnumber women in 
protagonist roles, and 
women serve as catalysts for the central conflicts throughout the nar
rative. Gaming narratives also tend to 
embody the male power fantasy trope, with both male and female protagonists bec
oming masculinized 
through the story’s progression.

The Female Protagonist in
Action-Adventure Video Games](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3530/a20409162a4cfcaf689414e4f1c30ab5e516.pdf)

This  paper  was  inspired  by  the  popularity  of  female  video  game protagonists   despite girls’   and   women’s   continued  hesitance   to participate  in  digital  gaming  activities.  The  pilot  study  examines  how the  imagery  and  narrative  structure  of  popular,  contemporary  video games construct  a  paradigm  of  the  ideal  female  heroine.  An  in-depth content analysis of three best-selling  action-adventure  video games  was  conducted. Key  findings  indicate   the  recurrence  of  a  paradoxical interplay  between  beauty  ideals  and  characterization,  wherein  the female  protagonist  must  reconcile  traditional  ideals  about  beauty  and body  type  with  the  decidedly  untraditional  gender  roles  and  actions she engages in.

[Real Boys Carry Girly Epics: Normalising Gender Bending in Online Games](http://www.eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos/article/viewArticle/vol2no1-5)

Players in online games frequently choose the opposite gender when they select an avatar. Previously, this has been attributed to a player's unconscious sexual anxieties and the need to experiment through the anonymous location of the avatar. However, this paper argues that the development of choice in games, where players have frequently selected the female form for ludic reasons, means that this choice has become normalised through a historical process. The avatar is frequently considered as a tool, with gender regarded as a freely admitted aesthetic pleasure. The player does not see this as a site of tension, or seeks to absolve this tension publicly as an act of appropriation typical to Jenkins¹ textual poachers.
Overall, the act of gender switching is not considered deviant within gaming; more, it is embraced as a common practise with historical precedents to support it.

[Gender Differences in Video Game Characters’ Roles, Appearances, and Attire as Portrayed in Video Game Magazines](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-007-9307-0)

Video game characters have the potential to shape players’ perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles. Forty-nine articles were coded from current U.S. gaming magazines, resulting in 115 coded characters. This content analysis of video game magazine articles investigated how characters are portrayed, focusing on gender differences. Males were more likely to be heroes and main characters, use more weapons, have more abilities, and were more muscular and powerful. Females were more often supplemental characters, more attractive, sexy, and innocent, and also wore more revealing clothing. Understanding these video game messages is an important first step in understanding the effects games and magazines may have on behavior and attitudes.

Video game characters are icons in youth popular culture, but research on their role in gender socialization is rare. A content analysis of images of video game characters from top-selling American gaming magazines showed male characters (83%) are more likely than female characters (62%) to be portrayed as aggressive. Female characters are more likely than male characters to be portrayed as sexualized (60% versus 1%), scantily clad (39% versus 8%) and as showing a mix of sex and aggression (39 versus 1%). A survey of teens confirmed that stereotypes of male characters as aggressive and female characters as sexually objectified physical specimens are held even by non-gamers. Studies are discussed in terms of the role media plays in socializing sexism.

Male Sexualization in Video Games](http://www.malinlovenberg.com/wp-content/uploads/Male-Sexualization-in-Video-Games-11th-march-2013.pdf)
This is a thesis based on a survey, targeted at sel
f-proclaimed gamers that identified 
themselves as homosexual males, male and female bis
exuals, and heterosexual females. The 
survey asked them the basic question “What constitu
tes a sexualized male for you?” 
The aim of the thesis is to find out if male sexual
ization exists in video games and, if it does, 
how males are sexualized. I analyzed video games wi
th focus on how male bodies are 
perceived and/or created for them. I used existing 
research in comparative fields, including 
research into illustrations found in Japanese video
 games and comics that are targeted based 
on sexualized males. I then analyzed male video gam
e characters in different genres based on 
the results.
